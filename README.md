The code repository for the book "Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Production: Architecture, Patterns, and Runbooks" by World Scientific Press. 

## Book Abstract
Artificial intelligence is racing ahead, but today’s Large Language Models still stumble on facts, freshness, and domain nuance. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this gap by fusing LLMs with live, external knowledge so systems can generate answers that are grounded, current, and context-aware. That capability is increasingly necessary in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, finance, education, legal, and customer service, where accuracy, traceability, and timeliness matter as much as fluency.
This book is an end-to-end, practical guide to LLM-based RAG from core concepts to production implementation with MLOps/LLMOps. It explains how retrieval, reranking, and generation work together; shows when RAG improves reliability (and when it doesn’t); and tackles 30+ real-world pain points such as data parsing, retrieval quality, response synthesis, evaluation, and agentic RAG patterns. Clear architectures, case studies, and runnable code walk you through deploying RAG pipelines, monitoring performance, mitigating hallucinations, and operating at scale. You’ll also get a balanced view of current limits and a forward look at how RAG informs emerging agentic AI systems that blend retrieval with planning, reasoning, and autonomy. Whether you’re an engineer, product leader, or researcher, this book equips you to build grounded, trustworthy AI that delivers business value today while preparing for what comes next.

# Book Contents
RAG isn’t just an AI technique—it’s a paradigm shift in machine knowledge management. When mastered, it creates systems that learn and adapt like seasoned experts. When mismanaged, it builds automated misinformation factories. The difference lies in recognizing that RAG implementation isn’t an IT project, but an ongoing knowledge governance discipline in a DevOps (Development and Operations) pipeline.  Therefore, we describe this pipeline in a systematic way in this book.

•	Chapter 2 establishes a foundation by surveying the modern ML lifecycle and its operational counterpart, MLOps, to gain a full picture of AI/ML production. We then generalize these principles to LLMOps—governing large-language-model systems—and, finally, to RAGOps, the specialized discipline of productionizing RAG architectures.

•	Chapter 3 maps the principal pain points that arise when RAG is pushed from prototype to production. It serves as an annotated table of contents for the twelve technical chapters that follow, each of which dives into advanced algorithms, implementation patterns, and runnable code, not a surficial introduction.

•	Chapter 4 inaugurates the RAG pipeline with data acquisition and preprocessing, covering ingestion, aggregation, cleansing, parsing, normalization and parallelism.

•	Chapter 5 addresses the text embedding technology, e.g., chunking strategies, embedding models, vector-store selection, and metadata governance, i.e., the building blocks for any high-recall retriever.  Over 10 chunking techniques are compared with different applicable scenarios. Tens of embedding models and vector databases are discussed for their pros and cons. 

•	Chapter 6 turns to query transformation and prompt engineering, showing how careful reformulation boosts both retrieval accuracy and generative coherence. The typical techniques of query rewriting, decomposition, iterative and routing techniques are illustrated with charts and codes. 

•	Chapter 7 operationalizes retrieval itself, demonstrating how to surface the most pertinent vectors from the stores engineered in Chapter 5, guided by the queries refined in Chapter 6. The pre-, in- and post-retrieval techniques are differentiated with focus on the in-retrieval phase.  The sparse, dense, advanced and hybrid approaches are discussed. 

•	Chapter 8 advances retrieval quality augmentation through reranking, context-window management (e.g., context compression), and hybrid search tactics. For example, the reranking technique, as one of the most important steps in post-retrieval, can be used to significantly improve the content relevancy. 

•	Chapter 9 presents controlled-generation methods that ground the language model firmly in retrieved evidence, thereby mitigating hallucinations and improving factual fidelity. The output format, response synthesis and model context are intensively discussed. 

•	Chapter 10 introduces rigorous evaluation frameworks in both component-level and end-to-end with over 10 commonly used metrics, while Chapter 11 translates those metrics into live serving and monitoring practices suitable for production traffic. 

•	Chapter 12 explores the auxiliary components in the RAG pipeline such as caching layers, memory stores, and task-specific fine-tuning, illustrating how their orchestration can lift overall performance beyond any single technique.

•	Chapters 13 through 15 push the frontier: Chapter 13 adapts RAG for natural-language-to-SQL systems; Chapter 14 integrates knowledge-graph reasoning via GraphRAG techniques; and Chapter 15 synthesizes agent workflows, i.e., Agentic RAG, that coordinate specialized agents and tools to solve enterprise-grade tasks across structured and unstructured data.

•	Chapter 16 closes the volume with a forward-looking synthesis. RAG is framed not as a terminus but as the current waypoint in the evolution of AI-driven knowledge management. The chapter surveys active research threads—self-improving retrievers, multimodal grounding, edge-native deployment, and autonomous agent coordination—and outlines how these advances may converge into an impending “RAG 2.0” paradigm. In doing so, it provides readers with a strategic lens for anticipating the next wave of techniques and for future-proofing the systems they design today.
